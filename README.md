# ToDo List - React

I've recently made a todo list with vanilla JS, but it didn't go well, the code was big and it had some bugs. I decided to make it smooth and clean, w/o any bugs with React since I've started learning it. I see a lot of changes in code, much more optimized etc. I really love React, and can't wait to get much better at it and use it at full potential! 😁
